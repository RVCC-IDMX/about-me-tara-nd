        <p>I want to be...</p>
        <p>an astronaunt and an excellent coder!</p>
        <p> Did you know that our hottest Planet in the Solar System is 450C, which is equal to 842 degree fahrenheit!</p> 
        <p>Our hottest planet isn't Mercury, as most probably guess since it is the Planet closest to the sun,</p>
        <p> Venus is actually the hottest! Mercury is not the hottest Planet since it has no atmosphere, which regulates temperature. </p>
        <p>I'm a total math geek, even if some problems may take me a long time to finally figure out. But the feeling after solving a problem you have been stuck on for a while is the greatest reward!</p>
