Creating this assignment over the semester was a terrific experience and project since I got to see how to actually create a website, unlike other classes that don't have nearly as much hands-on work. I'll begin by outlining the skills I've gained from this class. To begin with, learning how a website is made and published on the internet was intriguing to me. Then I learnt how to include images, create color palettes, and choose content for a website. When I combined GitHub with Netlify, I was baffled. I was able to get a better understanding of how these websites may help me in my webpage design career via repeated viewings of the videos and hands-on work and the assistance of the amazing Professors. The coding utilized in the project was also fantastic since I was able to see what code did what and how it operated. These types of homeworks help me understand code hierarchies, such as what comes before and what is included within, which is essential for understanding HTML and coding in general. Flex and grid confuse me, but I know how useful they are and want to learn more about them. Including a contact form and a video on a website is also thrilling. I never imagined I'd be able to complete it by the end of the semester. Rather of following a predefined programming strategy, it enabled me to build on what I know and add features that I like.

I mainly just use black and white colors, however, I did use #DBE7AB and #F9BBAF to give it that colorful look.
