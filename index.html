                <p>an astronaunt and an excellent coder!</p>
                <p><p>Hi, my name is Tara Nordmann and this is my about me website. 
                    <p>I’m an aspiring coder and a total science geek. I made my own website, </p>
                    <p>so make sure to check that out. Besides school I volunteer at a business</p>
                    <p> keeping track of their expenses etc. I’m from Germany and I used to travel</p>
                     <p>throughout Europe when I did my voluntary year(you basically just volunteer</p>
                     <p>for a year and get compensated). I visited Scandinavia, Italy,Spain,France, </p>
                    <p>the Netherlands, Poland and many more. I miss living in Germany sometimes,</p>
                    <p> simply because I love using public transportation. I do love that every city in</p>
                    <p> the U.S (I’ve seen so far) is big and has an amazing skyline. I enjoy working out,</p>
                    <p> learning new languages and anything science! Did you know that our hottest</p>
                     <p>Planet in the Solar System is 450C, which is equal to 842 degree fahrenheit!</p>
                    <p> Our hottest planet isn't Mercury, as most probably guess since it is the </p>
                    <p>Planet closest to the sun,Venus is actually the hottest! Mercury is not the</p>
                    <p> hottest Planet since it has no atmosphere, which regulates temperature.</p>
                    <p> I'm a total math geek, even if some problems may take me a long time to</p>
                    <p> finally figure out. But the feeling after solving a problem you have been</p>
                    <p> stuck on for a while is the greatest reward! My favorite math is calculus and anything functions.</p>

            <h2>Background Images</h2>

            <div>

                <p>We may make use of the background-image property without any further configuration. The url() function must be used to identify the picture source, regardless of whatever property we use. The value returned by the url() method will serve as a link to the background image, and the same concepts that apply to creating hyperlink pathways will apply here as well. Keep an eye out for different directories and be sure to provide the exact location of the photograph. The route will be included in parentheses and it will be quoted. As an example,:
                    div {
                      background-image: url("alert.png");
                    }
                    Because the background image will, by default, repeat horizontally and vertically from the top left of the given element to fill up the element's background, adding a background picture alone with a url value may result in adverse outcomes. Fortunately, we have the ability to customize how and whether the image repeats by using the background-repeat and background-position properties.
                    Background Repeat
                    Unless otherwise specified, a background image will loop indefinitely, both vertically and horizontally.
                    div {
                      background-image: url("alert.png");
                      background-repeat: no-repeat;
                    }
                    The background-repeat property accepts four different values: repeat, repeat-x, repeat-y, and no-repeat
                    Background Position
                    Background pictures are usually placed in the left upper corner of an element. We can, however, control where the background picture is positioned in relation to that corner by using the background-position property. Background-position needs two values: a horizontal offset (the first value) and a vertical offset (the second value) (the second value). If just one number is supplied, it is utilized for the horizontal offset, and the vertical offset is set to 50% by default.
                    
                    Background images are often placed at the left-most corner of an element's left-most corner. The background-position attribute, on the other hand, allows us to specify where the background image should be placed in reference to the corner in question. There are two values required for background-position: a horizontal offset (the first value) and a vertical offset (the second value) (the second value). If just one number is provided, it is used for the horizontal offset, and the vertical offset is set to 50% by default. If more than one number is provided, it is used for both the horizontal and vertical offsets. Because we're moving the background image away from the element's left top corner, the length values for that corner will be unique to that corner alone.
                    
                    To get the background-position value, we may use the keywords top, right, bottom, left, and center, as well as pixels, percentages, or any other measurement of length. Using keywords in conjunction with percentages has a very similar effect. Using the keyword value left top, which corresponds to the percentage value 0 0, you may maintain an image positioned in the element's left top corner. In this case, the keyword value right bottom corresponds to the percentage value 100% 100 percent, which will result in an image being shown in the element's right bottom corner.div {
                      background-image: url("alert.png");
                      background-position: 20px 10px;
                      background-repeat: no-repeat;
                    }
                    
                    
                    </p>
